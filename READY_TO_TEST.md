# ✅ RBAC Implementation - Ready for Testing

## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Backend (Complete)
1. **Role Permissions System** (`backend/src/common/constants/role-permissions.constant.ts`)
   - 4 roles defined: Admin, Manager, Technician, Viewer
   - Module access mapping for each role
   - Helper functions for permission checking

2. **Module Access Guard** (`backend/src/common/guards/module-access.guard.ts`)
   - Validates user role against required module
   - Returns 403 if unauthorized

3. **Protected Controllers**
   - ✅ UsersController - All endpoints protected
   - ✅ AssetsController - All endpoints protected
   - ✅ WorkOrdersController - All endpoints protected

4. **Seed Data**
   - ✅ Creates 4 system roles (admin, manager, technician, viewer)
   - ✅ Updates existing users with roleId
   - ✅ Test accounts for each role

### ✅ Frontend (Complete)
1. **Role Permission Utilities** (`frontend/lib/rolePermissions.ts`)
   - Role definitions matching backend
   - Action-level permissions (view, create, edit, delete)
   - Helper functions for UI logic

2. **RoleGuard Component** (`frontend/components/RoleGuard.tsx`)
   - Protects pages from unauthorized access
   - Shows "Access Denied 🔒" screen
   - Redirects or shows error message

3. **Protected Pages**
   - ✅ Users page - Full protection
   - ✅ Assets page - Full protection
   - ✅ PM page - Full protection
   - ⚠️ Work Orders page - Needs role guard (partially done)

4. **Action-Level UI**
   - ✅ Create buttons hidden for viewers
   - ✅ Edit buttons hidden for viewers  
   - ✅ Delete buttons hidden for technicians & viewers
   - ✅ "View only" labels for viewers

5. **Navigation Filtering**
   - ✅ Sidebar filters modules by role + license
   - ✅ Role badge displays in sidebar
   - ✅ Color-coded badges (purple=admin, blue=manager, green=tech, gray=viewer)

### ✅ Other Changes
- ❌ Removed pricing information (as requested)
- ✅ Billing page kept but shows "Pricing Coming Soon"
- ✅ Modules page shows "💡 Pricing Coming Soon"

| `manager@acme.com` | Manager | admin123 |
| `tech1@acme.com` | Technician | admin123 |
| `viewer@acme.com` | Viewer | admin123 |

## 🐛 Current Issue

**Problem:** "Generate WO" button in PM page gives "Internal server error"

**Root Cause (Investigating):**
- Backend may still be using old code without role fixes
- JWT token might not have roleId (though user logged out/in)
- PM mock data might have invalid assetId

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for backend to fully restart (~15 seconds)
2. Logout and login again as tech1
3. Try "Generate WO" again
4. If still fails, check backend terminal for actual error message

## ✅ What Should Work Right Now

### Admin (`admin@acme.com`)
- ✅ See all modules in sidebar
- ✅ "Administrator" purple badge
- ✅ All create/edit/delete buttons visible
- ✅ Can access Users page
- ✅ Can invite users
- ✅ Can edit/delete everything

### Manager (`manager@acme.com`)  
- ✅ See most modules (not IoT, AI, Multi-Tenant)
- ✅ "Manager" blue badge
- ✅ All CRUD buttons visible
- ✅ Can access Users page
- ✅ Can create/edit/delete

### Technician (`tech1@acme.com`)
- ✅ Limited modules (WO, Assets, PM, Mobile, etc.)
- ✅ "Technician" green badge
- ❌ "Users" NOT in sidebar
- ✅ Can create/edit
- ❌ Cannot delete (no delete buttons)
- ⚠️ "Generate WO" should work (currently broken)

### Viewer (`viewer@acme.com`)
- ✅ Very limited modules (Reports, Assets, WO, PM)
- ✅ "Viewer" gray badge
- ❌ No create/edit/delete buttons
- ✅ Shows "View only" in tables
- ❌ Cannot access Users page (shows Access Denied)

## 📋 Testing Checklist

Once backend restarts:

- [ ] Login as viewer - verify limited sidebar
- [ ] Try accessing /dashboard/users as viewer - should show "Access Denied"
- [ ] Login as tech1 - verify no "Users" in sidebar
- [ ] Try "Generate WO" as tech1 - should work
- [ ] Login as manager - verify can access Users
- [ ] Login as admin - verify full access

## 🚀 Status

**Backend:** Restarting with latest code...
**Frontend:** Running and ready
**Database:** Seeded with roles and test users

**Waiting for backend to finish starting, then ready to test!**
